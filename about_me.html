<h2>
    Hi, my name is Hana!
</h2>
<p>
    I'm a college student and graphic designer with a love for all kinds of vegan food and bad puns. When I'm not cooking, eating or taking pictures of food, I'm probably doing yoga, stressing out over some midterm or hunting for ghosts in my house.
</p>
<p>
    I started the Instagram account, "leavemeascone" in 2016 while studying abroad in Denmark. There were just too many beautiful dishes not to photograph, and I reached a point where I needed to save them all somewhere. It wasn't long before I because completely obsessed with food photography! 
</p>
    <p>
Upon returning to the U.S, I decided that I wanted to try out some more sustainable recipes. Turns out, plant-based food is just as delicious as meat, eggs and dairy (and it's a lot cheaper and healthier. I've fallen for vegan food and I can't get up.
